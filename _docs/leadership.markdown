## Leadership

#Founder Preamble
* We are committed to an organization in which the four founders act as servant leaders. 
* We put our strengths at the disposal of the organization in an advisory capacity. 
* The responsibilities for tasks follow the strengths of the founders. 
* Any holes below the waterline require consensus.
* We are committed to the founder mission statement.

You might know now a lot about our [roles](roles.html), values and teamstructure. But how does Leadership at Stylight look like? As you could read already under “Roles” our People Managers primary task is the development of employees assigned to her. The [HR Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3L8b7pbH5cHWlpVdDdtODRneTA) for People Managers give you important information on how to handle situations in your daily working life.
