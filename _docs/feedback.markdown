# Feedback

## Goal

Feedback should...

* be **helpful for personal growth**
* be valuable
* be relevant
* uncover blind spots

## When does feedback happen?

If you got feedback for someone, you shouldn't wait: give it to them right away. Nevertheless, we find it helpful to have some time cut out to reflect and get feedback. Otherwise, it's too easy to get burried in your work and not take the time to seek out feedback. Formalized feedback happens quarterly. The feedback sessions alternate between 1:1s with your manager and group meetings with your peer group. Getting feedback from a peer group is voluntary, but recommended. The fallback is having a session with your manager instead.

![Feedback timeline](../assets/FeedbackTimeline.png)

## Why we do peer feedback

* peers have valuable and meaningful feedback
* feedback by peers provides a broader perspective of one’s contribution (manager may work in other team)
* feedback from peers encourages teamwork and builds trust
* separation from pay raise decisions enables giving and receiving feedback in an open and non-judgmental way
* make re-selection a natural part of the process
* 3 peers is a good tradeoff between broad vs. deep feedback
* don’t do anonymous feedback for now, because of high risk of blowbacks and frustration

<a name="how"></a>

## How does this peer group thing work anyway?

* [Pick 3 people](#pick), and [invite](#invite) them to be in your peer group
* Arrange a 1 hour group meeting with them for the end of the quarter - pick a quiet space with a good atmosphere.
* In your invitation
  * Clarify what [kind of feedback](#kind) you are looking for right now.
  * Give your peers a set of [guiding questions](#guiding-questions) that you would like to discuss
* Before the meeting you and your peers reflect on the [guiding questions](#guiding-questions)
  * set yourself a 30 minute timebox
  * make some notes
* Meet as a group - in person, if possible.
  * Remind yourself on how to [give](#give) and [receive](#receive) feedback.
  * Everyone shares their points of view on the guiding questions - focus on behaviour, not the person.
  * Discuss - be curious, not defensive. Take some notes.
  * Come up with new personal development goals - during or after the session.
  * Thank your peers for their feedback.
* Reflect on the feedback - the received feedback is yours and yours alone,
you decide what to do with it

<a name="pick"></a>

## How to pick your peer group

* Who are the people that can give you the feedback that will help you grow? Generally this could be anyone. A member of your team, someone you worked with closely lately from another team, a client, ...
* Be honest to yourself about why you pick people. Don’t pick someone because you expect to hear nice things about yourself. This is not about stroking your ego. It won’t help you grow.
* Try to pick a diverse group in order to get a broad perspective. For instance different roles, personalities, gender, teams, how long they’ve been with Stylight, …
* Pick at least one person outside your team
* It’s up to you to cultivate trust with your peer group to get to the point where they feel safe enough to give you honest criticism.
* Experience shows that a group of 3 peers is a good tradeoff between broad vs. deep feedback

<a name="invite"></a>

## Invite people to be in your peer group

Ask them personally or write them an email. Something like this maybe.

> Hi,
>
> I would very much value your feedback. Please let me know, if you want to be in my peer group. If you do, please take 30 minutes to reflect on the following guiding questions about me and take some notes.
>
> _your favorite set of [guiding questions or metaphor](#guiding-questions) here_
>
> I will find a suitable time and send you an invite once I gathered my entire peer group.
>
> Thank you,
> _me_

Most people appreciate to know well ahead of time that you would like them in your peer group. The earlier you let them know, the better.

## Guiding questions or metaphor

You may pick a set of guiding questions that other companies use below. You can also mix and match or invent your own. Or pick one of these [retro tools [Stylight login required]](https://docs.google.com/a/stylight.de/document/d/1GPxiyIRg6B_rIrJ0mld02emoaAZ3IKFvx6pbD56FZbg/edit?usp=sharing). Which guiding questions work best for you also depends on what [kind of feedback](#kind) you are looking for.

## What kind of feedback are you looking for?

You should clarify this with your peer group before / at the beginning of your feedback session.

## How to give feedback

<table id="give-feedback">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../assets/growth.jpg" alt="growth"></td>
        <td><strong>Check your intentions</strong> Feedback is information intended to help others learn and grow. Blowback is information used to wound. If someone has let you down or performed poorly, and you’re feeling resentful or angry - deal with your own emotions before attempting to engage in a dialogue. When you feel a <em>genuine concern for the growth and development</em> of the other person, you’re ready to talk - and not a moment sooner.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../assets/behaviour.jpg" alt="behaviour"></td>
        <td><strong>Focus on behaviour, not the person</strong> Focusing the criticism on just the situation you want to address - on what someone <em>does or says</em>, rather than the individual themselves - separates the problematic situation from the person’s identity, allowing them to focus on what you’re saying without feeling personally confronted.</td>

<table id="receive-feedback">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../assets/ready.jpg" alt="ready"></td>
        <td><strong>Get ready before asking for feedback</strong> Never invite feedback until you are ready for it. “Ready” means that <em>you want to hear the truth</em>, not simply validation. If after receiving feedback you feel defensive, it might be that you wanted approval, not information.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../assets/inquiry.jpg" alt="inquiry"></td>
        <td><strong>Be curious, not defensive</strong> When receiving feedback, it might be tempting to become defensive or “explain away” the criticism. Do not debate or try to explain your behavior. Instead, let the other person finish completely and try to listen deeply. Then ask questions with the intent of inquiry. Request examples. Stay curious until - even if you don’t completely agree - you can see <em>how a reasonable, rational decent person would think what they think</em>. Later, you can decide what you agree or disagree with, but for now, your goal is simply to learn. Reflect thoughtfully on what you’ve heard.</td>

## FAQ

* **Does this work remotely? I don’t have any team member that work at the same location as me.**
  * Manuel: I worked in a distributed company before where we did peer group feedback sessions. We tried to do them in-person before or after company events when everyone was coming together anyway. But we also did them over hangouts. It is harder and not as great as in-person meetings, but it's doable. My suggestion would be that you try this with a peer group over hangout. If you find that it does not work for you at all, you can of course go back to what you are doing right now. I think though, that a peer group will provide added value for you. Even over hangout.
* **How much time should I spend on reflection / preparing for a peer group session?**
  * Manuel: I suggest to spend about 30 minutes on reflecting about the feedback recipient. A lack of preparation significantly decreases the benefit for the feedback recipient and suggests a lack of appreciation or interest.
* **Should I invite my manager to my peer group?**
  * Manuel: We deliberately separated the peer feedback from salary negotiations, because it allows for more open and honest feedback both as receiver as well as provider. I would advise against having her in your peer group, but in the end it’s up to you.
* **Who monitors the measures developed in the peer group session?**
  * Manuel: It is your own responsibility to implement the measures and goals developed in the peer group session. There is no monitoring by feedback providers or your manager, however you can ask for their help with the implementation.
* **Can I decline an invitation to a peer group?**
  * Manuel: If you don’t have the time to properly prepare for a peer feedback session or have any other important reason you may decline an invite. If someone declines to be in your peer group don’t be offended. It is probably more helpful if they say no rather than saying yes, but can’t put in the effort.
* **I just started working here. Should I still meet with a peer group?**
  * Manuel: Your peers may not be able to give you much feedback about your performance so far. You could, however, talk with them about your goals and aspirations by choosing more future focussed [guiding questions](#guiding-questions).
 
## How can I discuss my personal growth?

At Stylight we have a variety of possibilities of growing personally. What you see below is one tool which can help to visualize and discuss your personal growth. It was designed to act as conversation guideline for feedback sessions with your peers or manager.

There are five main characteristics that we find valuable in employees and we measure them in spheres of impact. Meaning, if you consistently demonstrate them on personal, team or company level.

1. You embody our three core [company **values** Enthusiasm, Appreciation and Responsibility](what-we-value.html).
2. You demonstrate **mastery** of your domain. How good are you in what you do?
3. You maximize the **business impact** of your work. How much do your actions influence the performance of the company?
4. You live **leadership**. Do you show initiative? Where do others follow your example?
5. You contribute to and engage with our **culture** on a wider scope than day-to-day work.

![Growth diagram](../assets/growthDiagram.png)

### Reach

1. **Individual**
You are focused primarily on being a useful contributor, gaining experience and learning how to be effective on your team. At this level, your focus should be on growing so that you can better support your team. This is the only level where there is an expectation that you should move to the next level.


2. **Team**
You are a valuable contributor to your team, either as a domain specialist or as a generalist. You should be able to lead smaller efforts coordinating with other members of your team and drive them to completion and/or dig into tough problems and solve them independently taking in feedback from your peers and focusing on the outcome.


3. **Company**
You have impact across teams. You lead cross-team efforts involving many people and drive them to completion and/or you take on large challenges, working with diverse stakeholders in multiple teams to solve a problem that affects the entire company. You are responsible for solving company-wide problems, and/or you are a go-to person across the company to solve very complex problems.

### Some questions to dig deeper

1. Values
 - How could you show our three core values more on a team level?
 - How could you show our three core values more on a company level?
 - Do our company values align with your own?
2. Mastery
 - What areas in your domain excite you?
 - How could you gain more knowledge in those areas?
 - How are these areas valuable for your team and Stylight as a whole?
 - What skills do you need to build up in order to achieve your personal goals?
3. Business Impact
 - Are you satisfied with the impact you have in your team and Stylight as a whole?
 - With your abilities, where would you have the most impact for the company?
 - What needs to happen to get there?
4. Leadership
 - What is your current leadership role within Stylight?
 - What would you want it to be like?
 - How do you get there?
5. Culture Impact
 - How would you describe Stylight's culture?
 - Is our culture a good fit for your personality?
 - How could you influence our culture more to be how you would like it to be?

The definition is intentionally vague. It is not necessary that your interpretation of it exactly matches everyone else's. On the contrary, the differences are where the most interesting conversations emerge from. The power of this tool comes from tracking your own progress over time and not so much from comparing yourself with others. Different roles have different reach profiles, which makes it especially counter-productive to compare yourself to people in other roles. Even though the goal is to grow, your impact may also shrink at some stage due to changes in your role or other circumstances. And that's OK.

### Example

![Growth diagram example](../assets/growthExample.png)

1. Values
 - I do BBLs about analytical thinking, I am the organizer of a guild for reporting enthusiasts and support the organisation of ship it days
 - I acknowledge the performance of my teammates and other colleagues in Stand-ups and Team Weekly.
 - I take on DRI responsibilities of holding workshops for Excel or Google Analytics for the company
 - I could be more enthusiastic when it comes to company wide projects/events
 - I could take on more responsibility by spreading topics also on a VP level

2. Mastery
 - I like to work with numbers, calculate our KPIs and derive action plans from it
 - I am in charge of our investment planning, etc.
 - I also provide other teams with reliable analysis & reports - I am the go to person, when a team needs help in setting up number driven decisions
 - I could improve my knowledge by setting clear short term and long term focus regarding my work & impact. And then I need to take the right measures (exchanges, mentor, workshops) to boost my expertise in order to achieve the goals I set myself.

3. Impact
 - By analysing our CPC we saved X€ per month.
 - I often take the responsibility for team projects as DRI
 - I always try to optimize not only the processes I work with but also help my colleagues to get better in what they are doing
 - I could increase my business impact by taking over the DRI role more often
 - I can also increase my impact by sharing important knowledge with our newbies (e.g. Agile/Coding/IT101)

4. Leadership
 - I organize my daily work, prioritize my tasks on my own and consistently keep stakeholders up to date.
 - I see many teammates following my example of how I document/communicate results
 - I could learn more about me being a leader by asking leadership focused questions in my next peer feedback 
 - I could increase my leadership scope by sharing interesting blog posts not only with my team but also with a wider audience via Slack channels

5. Culture
 - Our culture fits my personality. I can be completely myself and am accepted for who I am and how I work. I also enjoy being amongst other Stylighters - be it at work or outside of it.
 - I organize company wide team events, e.g. a running group.
 - I ensure that we celebrate team successes together (country launches, new hire, etc.)
 - I could increase my impact on culture by attending more team events, organizing our next team event...

### Patterns

There are some interesting patterns to look out for. Often there is a strong correlation between _values_ & _culture_, _mastery_ & _impact_ or _leadership_ & _impact_. If you find a big gap while comparing the reach of those areas with each other this might be worth discussing in order to identify areas for potential growth.

- Major difference in reach in values and culture
- Major difference in reach in mastery and impact
- Major difference in reach in leadership and impact

## Community

At Stylight we’re lucky to have a vibrant community that will help you along the way of your personal growth. You can use this community for feedback, exchange, cooperation, knowledge sharing, career ideas and coaching. We have formalized some of these community interactions but the real power comes from you owning and driving your growth.

![Growth community](../assets/growthCommunity.png)


## Personal development budget

You can use the feedback which you received from the community for chosing the right development activites for you. Every employee has a personal development budget. What you do with it is up to you. Go to conferences, buy books, participate in workshops or something entirely different. It’s your pick. You can find all the details in our [Development Budget Guidelines [Stylight login required]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yB6Ahp-iW8YsKSETBSXsO_wEw7skE4_weLBJPoI6kXs)
