# How we are structured

Even though we are growing, we try to keep the hierarchy as flat as possible and bureaucracy at a minimum. We avoid politics altogether. If you spot any politics or unnecessary bureaucracy, especially early on with a fresh look on things, please speak up so we can work together to get rid of it.

## Divisions, Departments & Squads

There are three divisions - inspiration (green), shopping (purple) and operations (blue). All departments (black & white) belong to one of these divisions. Most departments consist of a single squad. Squads are [cross-functional teams](http://engineering.stylight.com/formed-cross-functional-business-teams/) - meaning, they have all the skills they need to fulfil their mission. This also means that most of your squad colleagues will have different specialties than you do. A squad might consist of developers, designers, UX experts, business experts, etc.

## Guilds

Since squads are cut along business functions, employees with the same specialties are spread across different squads. To exchange knowledge within our specialties there are guilds (aka communities of practice or short CoPs). Which guilds you join is up to you. Go ahead and [browse the guild calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=stylight.de_3sci6nglq00utd2d6ocdml1938@group.calendar.google.com) and go to a few meetings to see if you like them. Missing a guild? Then start it!

Other ways we share knowledge are [Brown Bag Lunches](http://engineering.stylight.com/run-brown-bag-lunches/) and documenting our learnings from personal development - like books we read or conferences we attended - in [this tool](http://participativeorg.meteor.com?domain=stylight-com).
