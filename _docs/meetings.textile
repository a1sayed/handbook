h1. Meetings

Let’s face it, sitting around in meetings all day and not getting any actual work done sucks. So we try to keep meetings at a minimum and we make them optional. If you don’t learn or contribute to a meeting, then leave and do something more valuable with your time. Don’t just sit there and play with your phone. While attendance is optional, participation is mandatory. Here is a list of regular meetings that we hold and find valuable:
