# Development process

We work in [cross-functional teams](http://engineering.stylight.com/formed-cross-functional-business-teams/) that we call [squads](units.html). These squads work with processes that are heavily influenced by [Scrum](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7bgefahaiohjp16/Scrum-and-XP-from-the-Trenches-2nd-edition.pdf?dl=0) and [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyZEikKWhAU) [Agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qldY0g_dI) [Lean](http://www.allaboutagile.com/7-key-principles-of-lean-software-development-2/) [processes](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html). This puts a lot of emphasis on autonomy and self-organization. For instance, squad members are supposed to pull new work as they have free capacity, rather than having tasks assigned to them. If you worked at a more traditional command & control organisation before, this might take some getting used to. We are convinced though, that you eventually will find this way of working more fulfilling and motivating.
