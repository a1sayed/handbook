# A typical week

Most people come in between eight and nine o’clock-- some as early as seven and some later. It is up to you when you come in, but you should at least be here for your team’s [daily standup](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) and make it work with the schedules of your team mates. Our core hours - when we all try to be here - are from 10 - 17.

At 12:30ish most Stylighters venture out to find some food at one of the surrounding supermarkets and bring it back to eat together at the tables in the atrium or have a yummy lunch at one of many great restaurants in the area.

Most teams have synchronized two week development iterations (aka sprints) which start and end Wednesday-ish.

If you're lucky you'll witness a colleague holding a brown bag lunch. It's a short talk during lunch time where we learn about interesting topics from one another. It is usually someone from the company who talks about a topic he/she is interested in. This could be about absolutely anything really - whether it be the new tool you are working with or the zen in beekeeping.

On Fridays at 4 o’clock the entire company meets in the atrium and each department presents what they achieved this week at the Team Weekly - ‘team’ as in the entire company. Many grab a beer out of the fridge for this and stay afterwards to chat with colleagues or catch a game of beer or ping pong to start the weekend off right.
