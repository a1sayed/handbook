# Goals and measuring progress

We use Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to set goals and track our progress towards reaching them.

* Objectives are ambitious, qualitative, time-bound, and should feel somewhat uncomfortable
* Key Results are measurable and quantifiable; they should be easy to grade with a number (we use a 0 – 100% scale to grade each key result at the end of each quarter)
* OKRs are [accessible for every Stylighter  [Stylight login required]](https://drive.google.com/a/stylight.de/folderview?id=0B8kI3ttJEjJiVEtqZlVXSVVnbUU&usp=sharing;) every permanent employee in the company can see what everyone else is working on (and how they did in the past)
* For simplicity we measure our goals in percent and we are striving for 100%, not for Google’s 70%. Low grades shouldn’t be punished; see them as data to help refine the next quarter’s OKRs.
* OKRs are **not used for employee evaluation**. They are a communication tool that helps us arrive at a common understanding and alignment towards a goal.
* OKRs exist to set **clear priorities** and to *focus* the organization by aligning everyone towards the same goals. In order to do that, we use **few** OKRs. Each individual or team should have 1-3 objectives and 1-3 key results per objective. Less is more here.

## Company Strategic Goals
The strategic goals of the company build the basis for all our team OKRs. They are set each year by management.

## Team OKRs
Team OKRs are defined collaboratively every quarter and for each team in a bottom up approach. Each team defines objectives toward Stylight’s company mission and company OKRs. They help us arrive at a common understanding and align our efforts. Every team reports their progress during the Team Weekly.
