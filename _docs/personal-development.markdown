# Personal growth

## Career at Stylight

To make career at Stylight you don't have to become a manager, if that is not what you want. We equally value you getting better and growing your impact in your domain. We don't want Stylight to be only 'up or out'.

To discuss your personal development we use the following model. There are five main characteristics that we find valuable in employees and we measure them in sphere of impact. Meaning, if you consistently demonstrate them on personal, team or company level.

1. You embody our three core company values
   * Enthusiasm: Continuously improve yourself and team
   * Appreciation: Value team success over individual success
   * Responsibility: Hold yourself and others accountable
2. You demonstrate mastery of your domain
3. You maximize the business impact of your work
   * What do your actions mean for the company?
4. You live leadership (self and others)
5. You contribute to and engage with our unique Stylight culture
   * Wider scope than daily work

## Community

There is a vibrant community that will help you along the way of your personal growth. You can use it for feedback, exchange, cooperation, knowledge sharing, career ideas and coaching. Some of this we have formalized, but the real power comes from you owning and driving your growth.

## Personal development budget

Every employee has a personal development budget of 1.500 € (2.500 € for engineers, designers & VPs). What you do with it is up to you. Go to conferences, buy books, participate in workshops or something entirely different. It’s your pick. To pay for it, grab your supervisor’s credit card or [get reimbursed by submitting the receipts](https://docs.google.com/a/stylight.com/forms/d/12BfBoGYbt6KUBDiStRNqBhc9AE7dlYGhZLR5zYPaT-Q/viewform). Please track your budget in [Bamboo](https://stylight.bamboohr.co.uk/dashboard/) under Info > Training. If you are speaking at an event, this is covered but not deducted from your budget. [See here for more details](https://docs.google.com/a/stylight.de/document/d/1ScasE3gY8IF_2hMvk072gVJ5KiD2NDlHm9IF7epYj9I/edit?usp=sharing).
