# Personal development

Every employee has a personal development budget of 3 working days and 1.500 € (2.500 € for engineers & (E)VPs). What you do with it is up to you. Go to conferences, buy books, participate in workshops or something entirely different. It’s your pick. To pay for it, grab your supervisor’s credit card or [get reimbursed by submitting the receipts](https://docs.google.com/a/stylight.com/forms/d/12BfBoGYbt6KUBDiStRNqBhc9AE7dlYGhZLR5zYPaT-Q/viewform). Please track your budget in [Bamboo](https://stylight.bamboohr.co.uk/dashboard/) under Info > Training. If you are speaking at an event, this is covered but not deducted from your budget.
